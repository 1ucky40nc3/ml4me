## Abstract

[Abstract](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.08545.pdf)â€”*
Conventionally, audio super-resolution models fixed the initial
and the target sampling rates, which necessitate the model to be
trained for each pair of sampling rates. We introduce NU-Wave
2, a diffusion model for neural audio upsampling that enables
the generation of 48 kHz audio signals from inputs of various
sampling rates with a single model. Based on the architecture of NU-Wave, NU-Wave 2 uses short-time Fourier convolution (STFC) to generate harmonics to resolve the main failure
modes of NU-Wave, and incorporates bandwidth spectral feature transform (BSFT) to condition the bandwidths of inputs
in the frequency domain. We experimentally demonstrate that
NU-Wave 2 produces high-resolution audio regardless of the
sampling rate of input while requiring fewer parameters than
other models. The official code and the audio samples are available at* https://mindslab-ai.github.io/nuwave2
